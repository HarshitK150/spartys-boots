# Sparty's Boots

**Sparty’s Boots** is a logic-based puzzle game where you control Sparty’s powerful kicks using logic gates! Objects move along a conveyor belt, and your job is to set up the correct **logic gate combinations** to determine which ones Sparty kicks off.  

## How It Works  
1. **Sensors on the Conveyor** detect objects as they pass.  
2. **Logic Gates** (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, SR Flip FLops and D Flip Flops) process the sensor signals.  
3. **Sparty’s Boots** receive the final signal and kick objects based on your logic setup.  

## The Challenge  
Your goal is to design the **correct logic circuit** to kick only the **target objects** while letting others pass. As the game progresses, gate placement becomes more complex, testing your problem-solving skills. 

Think fast, wire smart, and make sure Sparty’s Boots only kick what they should!
